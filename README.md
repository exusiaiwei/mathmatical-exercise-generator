## 📖 Introduction
The **Mathematical Exercise Generator** is an unofficial project developed for the Foundations of Mathematics Course at Saarland University, LST. This project is designed to automatically generate mathematical exercises to provide students with additional practice. The generator currently focuses on vector and matrix algorithms, with plans to expand into more areas in the future.

## ✨ Features
- Randomly generated mathematical exercises.
- Currently supports vector and matrix algorithms.
- Exercises can be generated weekly through GitHub Actions or manually.
- Automatically uploaded PDFs of generated exercises to the Releases section.

## ⚙️ Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and set up GitHub Actions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/exusiaiwei/mathmatical-exercise-generator.git
cd mathmatical-exercise-generator
```
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and settings for GitHub Actions in your repository.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. To generate exercises, either wait for the scheduled GitHub Actions to run or trigger them manually.
2. Download the generated PDFs from the [Releases section](https://github.com/exusiaiwei/mathmatical-exercise-generator/releases).
